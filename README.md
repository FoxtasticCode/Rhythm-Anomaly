# Rhythm-Anomaly
is a 4-Key Rhythm-Game. It will have updates in the future (like animated BGs etc.) and multiple chart-options that are not time, row. I'll hope this game gets better in near future and gets like i want it to be! Charting is very easy being in XML and having only two attributes. A line could look like this: ```<1 time="1.25" row="3"></1>```! BGs (how i plan them to be) are like: ```<sprite img="images/MySprite.png"></sprite>```. So i hope that there are comming more and more charts to the game made by you!

Future updates TODO
- Unlockable Characters made to make the game easy or to a hell 2.0
- Account system
- Multiplayer (is going to take more than one update tho)

Hope that if you found this that you have hope in this and come later again!

BYEEEE
